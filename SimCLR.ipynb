        "\n",
        "Using the data loader pipeline above, we can now implement SimCLR. At each iteration, we get for every image $x$ two differently augmented versions, which we refer to as $\\tilde{x}_i$ and $\\tilde{x}_j$. Both of these images are encoded into a one-dimensional feature vector, between which we want to maximize similarity which minimizes it to all other images in the batch. The encoder network is split into two parts: a base encoder network $f(\\cdot)$, and a projection head $g(\\cdot)$. The base network is usually a deep CNN as we have seen in e.g. [Tutorial 5](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html) before, and is responsible for extracting a representation vector from the augmented data examples. In our experiments, we will use the common ResNet-18 architecture as $f(\\cdot)$, and refer to the output as $f(\\tilde{x}_i)=h_i$. The projection head $g(\\cdot)$ maps the representation $h$ into a space where we apply the contrastive loss, i.e., compare similarities between vectors. It is often chosen to be a small MLP with non-linearities, and for simplicity, we follow the original SimCLR paper setup by defining it as a two-layer MLP with ReLU activation in the hidden layer. Note that in the follow-up paper, [SimCLRv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029), the authors mention that larger/wider MLPs can boost the performance considerably. This is why we apply an MLP with four times larger hidden dimensions, but deeper MLPs showed to overfit on the given dataset. The general setup is visualized below (figure credit - [Ting Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029)):\n",

        "\n",
        "After finishing the training with contrastive learning, we will remove the projection head $g(\\cdot)$, and use $f(\\cdot)$ as a pretrained feature extractor. The representations $z$ that come out of the projection head $g(\\cdot)$ have been shown to perform worse than those of the base network $f(\\cdot)$ when finetuning the network for a new task. This is likely because the representations $z$ are trained to become invariant to many features like the color that can be important for downstream tasks. Thus, $g(\\cdot)$ is only needed for the contrastive learning stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that the architecture is described, let's take a closer look at how we train the model. As mentioned before, we want to maximize the similarity between the representations of the two augmented versions of the same image, i.e., $z_i$ and $z_j$ in the figure above, while minimizing it to all other examples in the batch. SimCLR thereby applies the InfoNCE loss, originally proposed by [Aaron van den Oord et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03748) for contrastive learning. In short, the InfoNCE loss compares the similarity of $z_i$ and $z_j$ to the similarity of $z_i$ to any other representation in the batch by performing a softmax over the similarity values. The loss can be formally written as:\n",

In other words, we learn a single, linear layer that maps the representations to a class prediction. Since the base network $f(\\cdot)$ is not changed during the training process, the model can only perform well if the representations of $h$ describe all features that might be necessary for the task.

To make the comparison to the contrastive learning models fair, we apply data augmentations similar to the ones we used before: horizontal flip, crop-and-resize, grayscale, and gaussian blur. Color distortions as before are not used because the color distribution of an image showed to be an important feature for the classification. Hence, we observed no noticeable performance gains when adding color distortions to the set of augmentations. Similarly, we restrict the resizing operation before cropping to the max. 125% of its original resolution, instead of 1250% as done in SimCLR. This is because, for classification, the model needs to recognize the full object, while in contrastive learning, we only want to check whether two patches belong to the same image/object. Hence, the chosen augmentations below are overall weaker than in the contrastive learning case."

        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we have discussed self-supervised contrastive learning and implemented SimCLR as an example method. We have applied it to the STL10 dataset and showed that it can learn generalizable representations that we can use to train simple classification models. With 500 images per label, it achieved an 8% higher accuracy than a similar model solely trained from supervision and performs on par with it when only using a tenth of the labeled data. Our experimental results are limited to a single dataset, but recent works such as [Ting Chen et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029) showed similar trends for larger datasets like ImageNet. Besides the discussed hyperparameters, the size of the model seems to be important in contrastive learning as well. If a lot of unlabeled data is available, larger models can achieve much stronger results and come close to their supervised baselines. Further, there are also approaches for combining contrastive and supervised learning, leading to performance gains beyond supervision (see [Khosla et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11362)). Moreover, contrastive learning is not the only approach to self-supervised learning that has come up in the last two years and showed great results. Other methods include distillation-based methods like [BYOL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733) and redundancy reduction techniques like [Barlow Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230). There is a lot more to explore in the self-supervised domain, and more, impressive steps ahead are to be expected.\n",
